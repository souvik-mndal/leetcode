# 3501. Maximize Active Section with Trade II

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topics:** Array, String, Binary Search, Segment Tree

## Description
You are given a binary string s of length n, where:

You can perform at most one trade to maximize the number of active sections in s. In a trade, you:

Additionally, you are given a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [l_i, r_i] represents a substring s[l_i...r_i].

For each query, determine the maximum possible number of active sections in s after making the optimal trade on the substring s[l_i...r_i].

Return an array answer, where answer[i] is the result for queries[i].

Note

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "01", queries = [[0,1]]
Output: [1]
Explanation:
Because there is no block of '1's surrounded by '0's, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "0100", queries = [[0,3],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [4,3,1,1]
Explanation:
Query [0, 3] &rarr; Substring "0100" &rarr; Augmented to "101001" Choose "0100", convert "0100" &rarr; "0000" &rarr; "1111". The final string without augmentation is "1111". The maximum number of active sections is 4.
Query [0, 2] &rarr; Substring "010" &rarr; Augmented to "10101" Choose "010", convert "010" &rarr; "000" &rarr; "111". The final string without augmentation is "1110". The maximum number of active sections is 3.
Query [1, 3] &rarr; Substring "100" &rarr; Augmented to "11001" Because there is no block of '1's surrounded by '0's, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.
Query [2, 3] &rarr; Substring "00" &rarr; Augmented to "1001" Because there is no block of '1's surrounded by '0's, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1000100", queries = [[1,5],[0,6],[0,4]]
Output: [6,7,2]
Explanation:
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "01010", queries = [[0,3],[1,4],[1,3]]
Output: [4,4,2]
Explanation:
Query [0, 3] &rarr; Substring "0101" &rarr; Augmented to "101011" Choose "010", convert "010" &rarr; "000" &rarr; "111". The final string without augmentation is "11110". The maximum number of active sections is 4.
Query [1, 4] &rarr; Substring "1010" &rarr; Augmented to "110101" Choose "010", convert "010" &rarr; "000" &rarr; "111". The final string without augmentation is "01111". The maximum number of active sections is 4.
Query [1, 3] &rarr; Substring "101" &rarr; Augmented to "11011" Because there is no block of '1's surrounded by '0's, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 2.
```

## Constraints
- '1' represents an active section.
- '0' represents an inactive section.
- Convert a contiguous block of '1's that is surrounded by '0's to all '0's.
- Afterward, convert a contiguous block of '0's that is surrounded by '1's to all '1's.
- For each query, treat s[l_i...r_i] as if it is augmented with a '1' at both ends, forming t = '1' + s[l_i...r_i] + '1'. The augmented '1's do not contribute to the final count.
- The queries are independent of each other.
- 1 <= n == s.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
- s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
- queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]
- 0 <= l_i <= r_i < n
