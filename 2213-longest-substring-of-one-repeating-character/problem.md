# 2213. Longest Substring of One Repeating Character

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topics:** Array, String, Segment Tree, Ordered Set

## Description
You are given a 0-indexed string s. You are also given a 0-indexed string queryCharacters of length k and a 0-indexed array of integer indices queryIndices of length k, both of which are used to describe k queries.

The i^th query updates the character in s at index queryIndices[i] to the character queryCharacters[i].

Return an array lengths of length k where lengths[i] is the length of the longest substring of s consisting of only one repeating character after the i^th query is performed.

## Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = &quot;babacc&quot;, queryCharacters = &quot;bcb&quot;, queryIndices = [1,3,3]
Output: [3,3,4]
Explanation:
- 1st query updates s = &quot;bbbacc&quot;. The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is &quot;bbb&quot; with length 3.
- 2nd query updates s = &quot;bbbccc&quot;.
The longest substring consisting of one repeating character can be &quot;bbb&quot; or &quot;ccc&quot; with length 3.
- 3rd query updates s = &quot;bbbbcc&quot;. The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is &quot;bbbb&quot; with length 4.
Thus, we return [3,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = &quot;abyzz&quot;, queryCharacters = &quot;aa&quot;, queryIndices = [2,1]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
- 1st query updates s = &quot;abazz&quot;. The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is &quot;zz&quot; with length 2.
- 2nd query updates s = &quot;aaazz&quot;. The longest substring consisting of one repeating character is &quot;aaa&quot; with length 3.
Thus, we return [2,3].
```

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
- s consists of lowercase English letters.
- k == queryCharacters.length == queryIndices.length
- 1 <= k <= 10^5
- queryCharacters consists of lowercase English letters.
- 0 <= queryIndices[i] < s.length
